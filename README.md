# Three-Way-Quick-Sort [![PRs Welcome](https://img.shields.io/badge/PRs-welcome-brightgreen.svg?style=flat-square)](https://makeapullrequest.com)

Java code for three way quick sort which implements the three way quick sort partitioning process to efficiently handle duplicates and have order of growth of running time changed from quadratic to even linear(in some applications).It is important to note that normal implementation of quick sort would take quadratic time in such cases, in addition shuffling is done in client sort method to provide a probabilistic guarantee against worst case(quadratic time) resulting in dealing with randomized input.
