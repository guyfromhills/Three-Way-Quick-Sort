# Three-Way-Quick-Sort
Java code for three way quick sort which implements the three way quick sort partitioning process to efficiently handle duplicates and have order of growth of running time equal to NlogN (and in some cases even linear) as opposed to normal implementation of quick sort which would take quadratic time in such cases, in addition shuffling is done in client sort method to provide a probabilistic guarantee against quadratic time resulting in dealing with randomized input.
